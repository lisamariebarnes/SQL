# Lisa Marie Barnes SQL Portfolio :bar_chart:

Welcome to my SQL (Structured Query Language) portfolio! Here you will find a curated collection of SQL code that demonstrates my experience and proficiency in managing, querying, and manipulating data in relational databases.

Whether you call it "SQL" or "SEQUEL," it's all about empowering data-driven decisions and simplifying complex data interactions.

## :file_folder: What's Inside?

In this repository, you'll find examples of:

- **Query Writing**: Crafting efficient and complex queries to extract meaningful insights.
- **Database Design**: Designing robust and scalable database structures.
- **Data Manipulation**: Using SQL to clean, transform, and analyze data.
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimizing queries for improved performance.

Each folder or file in this repository represents a specific project or challenge I've tackled, and I've made an effort to comment the code to clarify my thought process and techniques.

## :question: Questions or Comments?

I appreciate your interest in my work! Feel free to explore, and if you have any questions, comments, or just want to discuss SQL in general, don't hesitate to reach out. 

Happy Querying! :zap:
